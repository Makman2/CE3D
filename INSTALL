6.  Install pdcurses. (###Detailed information for this step will follow.###)
7.  Download or clone the CE3D-repository.
8.  Switch to the CE3D directory, create a new folder named "build" and switch
    into it.
9.  Now run:
        cmake ..\src\

10. The compiled files can be found in the build directory.
    includes:   \build\include
    libs:       \build\lib
