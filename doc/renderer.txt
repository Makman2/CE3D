The CE3D renderer classes are separated over multiple libraries,
because the rendere often need specific external libraries (like
OpenGL for the OpenGL renderer). The only renderer embedded into
the core library is the console renderer.

Planned layout:

ce3d.dll/so  ->  console renderer

ce3d_opengl.dll/so -> OpenGL renderer
