This is a draft which contains a short descriptions of the CodeChecker rules which shall be implemented for this project.

* one space before brackets of a control flow keyword (if ())
* no space before brackets of function declarations (function(params))
* typedef's are not allowed. Use "using" instead for C++0x compliancy
* use 4 spaces as tab. Tabs are not allowed
* first line has to be our copyright comment
* last line has to end with \n
* for every class there has to be a test
* include guards have to be on line 3, 4 and last with the given syntax
* don't use raw pointers - use smart pointers instead!
* use override and final whenever it is possible for cleaner code.
* use nullptr instead of NULL (NULL must not be used in the whole project!)
* when using the angle bracked for templates, two of the same brackets must have a space between them.
